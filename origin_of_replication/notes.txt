Where in the genome does DNA replication begin?

Replication begins in a genomic region called the replication origin (denoted ori) and is carried out by molecular copy machines called DNA polymerases.

Questions:
1. Where is the ori located?
2. How does the bacterial cell know to begin replication exactly in this short region within a larger chromosome?

- replication is mediated by DnaA which binds to a short segment within the ori known as DnaA box
